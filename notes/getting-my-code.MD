# Getting Instructor's Code.

## Make sure your `pull-instructor-code.sh` is updated:

```sh
npx gitpick -o JeffryGonzalez/applied-angular-jan-2026/tree/master /c/Users/Student/class/instructor-code
```

> Put this in the file, make sure it is saved.

1. In the "Explorer" view of VSCode (the top icon on the left), go to the bottom where it says "NPM SCRIPTS".
2. Click the "Play" (|>) button on the "pull-instructor-code" script.
   - **If you get an error here, let me know, please**
3. Click the "Diff Folders" icon on the left (last one, little lines.)
4. _This is the point my Dr's office answered the phone_
5. On the "DIFF FOLDERS" Ui, click the "Instructor <-> You" favorite at the top.
6. You might have to hit "compare" again.
7. The left side of the screen is the instructor code, the right is yours. Differences should be highlighted\*.
8. Click on a file that is different, and hit the icon to move the file from the left to the right.
9. Repeat as necessary (as it says on the shampoo bottle)

It is best to click the buttons that are:

- Show all deleted files
- Show all modified files
- Show all created files

The icons for these are hard (for me) to decipher. Just hover over them.
