# Some Suggestions

This is the most important part of an Angular application.

It is also the part that is the most "fidgety".

Don't be a good programmer until you know what you are doing.

"RUG" - "Repeat Until Good"

Don't hurry to refactor, design, worry about duplication.

You are "Coding Around and Finding Out".

- In UI Development you have to have a thick skin. You will get a _lot_ of _feedback_.
- You want that feedback, you have to take it.

# Process

1. Iterate on making it look "right"
2. Make it "work"
   1. Extract "view model"
   2. Fake the data
   3. Think about modes
3. Make it "good"
   1. Create components, hierarchies, all that.
